<h2>ES2015 (JavaScript.Next) R&D</h2>

<h3>Introducing</h3>

<p>JavaScript is changing. Significant new syntax improvements will make it
  a very different looking language. Browser makers are slowly implementing
  the updates as you read this.</p>

<p>To keep current I want to learn what's coming
  now. That sounds difficult, but we can use <a href="https://babeljs.io/">BabelJS</a>
  to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler">transpile</a>
  code written in new ES2015 syntax to plain old JS that runs in any browser.
  You can have the future now!</p>

<h3>Learning Specific ES2015 Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>const variables - global in app.js</li>
  <li>default values - TimeSucker() in app.js</li>
  <li>let for scoped variables - TimeSucker() in app.js</li>
  <li>arrow anonymous functions - ReportTheSuck() in app.js</li>
  <li>string interpolation - ReportTheSuck() in app.js</li>
  <li>spread operator - setupColors() in app.js</li>
  <li>class, subclass, super, static, getters, setters - user.js</li>
  <li>more exist for you to discover!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing BabelJS for ES2015 Now</h3>

<p>Install BabelJS in OSX <strong>Terminal</strong> with this command:</p>
<code>npm install -g babel</code>

<h3>Running</h3>

<p>Compile the entire <code>src</code> directory and output it to the one
  concatenated file. Do this by running in the project's main subdir
  <strong>Terminal</strong>:</p>
<code>babel ./code --out-file main.js --watch --source-maps</code>

<p>Open the <em>Chrome Developer Tools</em> and look at the <em>Console</em>
  seeing program results. Read the code and confirm why the run-time output is
  interesting.
</p>

<p>Discover the source code that BabelJS compiles to <code>main.js</code>. It's
  fascinating how the tool's authors are leveraging JavaScript as it exists today.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging code in written in ES2015 and transpiled into plain old J/S must be horrible!
  Browsers are machines and don't care what the mangled output of BabelJS looks like.
  Programmers are human beings, and we want to read rational things. How can we possibly
  make any sense of original authored code and what's written after?</p>

<p>Don't have to, and it's wonderful.</p>

<p> Chrome has <a
  href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">source-maps</a>
  and BabelJS writes them.
  Because of that, when you open up the <em>dev tools</em>, you'll see your original code
  as you wrote it in ES2015. Set break points, single step, inspect variables. It's
  exactly as you want it.</p>

<h3>Additional Reading</h3>

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">Luke
  Hoban's</a> summary on ES2015 features.</p>

<p>JavaScript is based on ECMAScript-262 and if you read the <a
  href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">formal 6th edition
  specification</a> you'll learn a lot, and you might go completely mental.</p>

<p>Many refer to the <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">Kangex
  table</a> tracking browser compatibility.</p>

<h3>Acknowledging</h3>

<p>I had the great fortune of giving a talk called <a
  href="http://www.slideshare.net/KaDawg/measuring-the-mobile-experience-the-analytics-of-handheld-ux">Measuring
  the Mobile Experience: The Analytics of Handheld UX</a> at <a
  href="http://www.html5devconf.com/speakers.html">HTML5DevConf
  in San Fransisco</a> in Oct 2015.</p>

<p>Also an attendee, I dropped in on a session by David Greenspan. His call to
  action was <em>learn ES2015 now</em> - and so I am! All of this work is a result
  of his influence.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>Some of this work takes advantage of the browser's
  <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/">User
    Timing</a> API for high-resolution timers. APIs include:</p>
<code>performance.mark(), .measure(), .getEntriesByType()</code>

<p>These are applicable for a performance-monitoring system.</p>
