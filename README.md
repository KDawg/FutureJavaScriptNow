# ES2015 R&D

## Introducing
I want to start leaning (and using) now the new JavaScript syntax rolling out to browsers as future updates.

Use [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/) to [transpile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) from ES2015 to plain old JavaScript running in any modern browser. Use the future hotness now!

Install BabelJS in **Terminal** with this command: `npm install -g babel`

## Running
Compile the entire `src` directory and output it to the one concatenated file running in **Terminal**: `babel ./code --out-file main.js --watch`

pen the developer tools and look at the *Console* to see all of the program results. Read the code to see why the run-time output is pertinent.

Discover the J/S BabelJS compiles into `main.js`.

## Learning
I enjoyed reading [Luke Hoban's](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) summary on ES2015 features.

This [survey of ES2015](http://es6-features.org/) is enlightening as well.

JavaScript is based on ECMAScript-262 and if you read the [formal 6th edition specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) you'll learn a lot, and you might go completely mental in the process.

Many refer to the [Kangex table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) tracking browser compatibility.
